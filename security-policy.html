  <h1>Security Policy for Plugins and Apps</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Allegro Labs Security Policy was compiled in accordance with ISO27001 Information Security Management System
      standard.
      The Policy outlines a systemic approach to the process of managing sensitive third-party data and information in
      relation
      to the Allegro Labs products.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the term “data” is used in this document to indicate both data (plural and singular), as well as the
      information that data represents.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p>
      The objective of this Policy is to establish the process and procedures aimed at protecting sensitive third-party
      data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Process</h2>

    <p>
      At a high level, Allegro Labs will ensure that the following process is in place:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Identify, for each product, what sensitive data is being stored.</li>
      <li>Clarify how sensitive the data is stored, breaking it down into as granular sections as required.</li>
      <li>Actively avoid storing sensitive data wherever possible.</li>
      <li>
        Where sensitive data must be stored, ensure it is stored in the most secure sections of our infrastructure and
        will not be
        transferred to less secure sections (unless under appropriate encryption during transit).
      </li>
      <li>
        Where sensitive data is managed by a third-party, ensure those parties implement robust security policies and
        actively check
        those policies are updated and enforced.
      </li>
      <li>Actively review internal code for security vulnerabilities and ensure understanding of the process to follow
        when any are found.
      </li>
      <li>Actively review any external code used for security vulnerabilities and ensure the understanding of the
        process to follow when any are found.
      </li>
    </ol>
